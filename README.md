# python-challenge

Background:

In this assignment, I used newly learned Python scripting skills to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank Instructions

For this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze a company's financial records. I was given a financial dataset ('budget_data.csv') composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses" and created a script that calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, my final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.


PyPoll Instructions

For this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data ('election_data.csv') composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote

- Your analysis should align with the following results:

In addition, my final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
